    "# **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**    \n",
    "The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that will predict taxicab trip fare before riding based on 2022 NYC Yellow Cab trip record data (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/2022-Yellow-Taxi-Trip-Data/qp3b-zxtp).\n",
    "To that end, I will demonstrate the phases of the data science pipeline:\n",
    "1. **[Random Sampling](#sampl)** Make a Random Sample from the large original CSV file with (39.7 Milions rows & Size More than 3.5 GB) to make the analysis and modeling process more efficient: \n",
    "2. **[Preprocessing](#prep)**: Clean and transform the data into a usable format for analysis.\n",
    "3. **[Exploratory Analysis](#eda)**: Perform exploratory analysis to identify the best features to be used for modeling.  And Test the Models Assumptions to choose suitable model for the data\n",
    "4. **[Algorithm Development](#ml)**: Train, test, and refine various models to predict the target variable.  Given that our dependent variable `trip_duration` is a continuous outcome,  the regression algorithms to be protoyped are as follows:\n",
    " - [Multivarite Linear Regression](#linear)  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **[Model Deployment](#deployment)**: Apply the best performing model to the test set for contest submission.\n",
